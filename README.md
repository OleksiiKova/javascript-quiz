## UX

### Strategy

This quiz is designed to help you make sure of your knowledge, and also relax and have fun. The website is designed in such a way that it can be replaced with any other questions, and in any quantity. Therefore, it can be used for absolutely any topic.

### Scope

JavaScript quiz is primarily created for developers of all levels to test their knowledge. It can be used both for entertainment purposes and as part of a Sowtware Development courses.

### Structure

Website pages:

1. Home page: contains introduction section and rules to the quiz.
2. Quiz page: contains JS quiz.
3. Feedback page: contains feedback form to improve the site.

All pages have a header that allows you to navigate to different pages from any place.

### Skeleton

The website is designed to be clear and simple. To create a wireframe I used Balsamiq software. PDF file with my wireframe you cand find [here](/readme_images/wireframe_js_quiz.pdf).

### Surface

To prevent the site from being too cluttered, I used a palette of only three colours.


<!-- JavaScript quiz consists of only one main page, but thanks to JS it allows you to replace content when it is needed and how many times it is needed. -->
